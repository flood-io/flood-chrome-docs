# `Until`

Until is used to create wait <[Conditions]> which are used to wait for elements to become active, visible, invisible or disabled on the page.

You would typically use these to control the flow of you test.

#### `until.ableToSwitchToFrame(frame)`
* `frame` <string|number|[Locatable]>  
* returns: <[Condition]> 

Creates a condition that will wait until the input driver is able to switch to the designated frame.

The target frame may be specified as:
- string name of the frame to wait for matching the frame's `name` or `id` attribute.
- (Coming soon) numeric index into window.frames for the currently selected frame.
- (Coming soon) locator which may be used to first locate a FRAME or IFRAME on the current page before attempting to switch to it.

Upon successful resolution of this condition, the driver will be left focused on the new frame.

* returns: <[Condition]> 

Creates a condition that waits for an alert to be opened. Upon success, the returned promise will be fulfilled with the handle for the opened alert
